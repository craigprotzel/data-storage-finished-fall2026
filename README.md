Data Storage Workshop - Finished Code
------------------------------------

This example was built using the starter code and steps outlined here
https://github.com/craigprotzel/data-storage-starter

Additional `GET` routes have been added to the server to make `fetch()` requests to another server -
- `app.get('/special-data')` - uses syntax similar to the client
- `app.get('/special-data-alt')` - uses the `async-await` syntax
